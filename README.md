# AdventOfCode

Welcome to my Advent of Code project! Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve a series of programming puzzles provided by [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).

This project contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, written in C#. The solutions are organized by year and day, with each day's solution contained in its own folder.

To use this project, navigate to the folder for the day you wish to solve, then implement the interface ``IResolvable`` and run the ``dotnet run`` command.

I hope you find these solutions helpful and that they inspire you to participate in Advent of Code!
